## THE RULE: teach Queen (Marko, 12.11.2026, enforced)

Every task Marko asks of or through Queen ends with Queen able to do it alone: a skill file in
`queen_skills/<name>.md` (when, steps, routes, checks, traps; loaded into her system prompt every turn), the route or
local chat command it needs, a test by asking her in her own chat, `./install.sh`, restart, push to main.
MANTRA_MANIFEST modules/teach-queen.md. Her skills so far: see `queen_skills/`.

## Local Claude Code first, never API credits without his yes (Marko, 12.11.2026)

Queen reaches the local Claude Code (headless `claude -p`, claude.ai plan) through `/api/claude/*` and the chat line
`ask claude <q>`; Claude sessions reach her through `queen "<q>"`. Every Anthropic/Google API path (`/api/brain/escalate`,
`/api/auto_update/run`) goes local first; unreachable -> "I cannot reach the local Claude Code. Do you want to use API
credits?" (409 need_consent), API only with `allow_api: true` after his yes. Start Queen without the CLAUDE* env of a session.
MANTRA_MANIFEST modules/queen-local-claude-first.md.
# Groq AI Studio

**Note:** "Queen" = `qwen` command. When Marko says "Queen", he means this qwen application.

Read `TAKEOVER.md` in the repo first: it holds everything known (files, commands, HTTP API, dangers, what is untested).

## Space
- Source: ~/Developer/groq_ai_studio (public, no README by rule). Running copy: ~/.groq (`./install.sh` copies source there).
- Auto-update repo: `markoboskoauroville/groq-auto-update` (public). CI-validated updates are pushed here automatically.
- Start: `qwen` (port 8765, first free port after it; `~/.groq/app_url` says which). Health: `curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/health`.
- Keys: ~/.groq/keys.txt and ~/Downloads/API/groq-api.txt: never print, never commit. Masked form only.
- Chats: ~/.groq/chats/ — server-side JSON files, local only, NOT in git.
- Test a turn without the browser: `curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/remote/send -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"prompt":"hi"}'` (spends tokens: say so).

## Version System
- Version stored in `version.json` at repo root: `{"version": N, ...}`
- Displayed as `vN` badge in the top-right corner of the web UI
- Bumps by 1 on every successful CI-validated update
- Check current version: `GET /api/version`

## Self-Update Pipeline (CI-gated)
The app can update its own source files through a chunked transfer system:
1. Code is sent in chunks via `POST /api/self_update/chunk` (file, part number, content)
2. `POST /api/self_update/assemble` runs the CI pipeline before writing:
   - **Python:** AST parse, truncation detection (unbalanced quotes/brackets), structural checks
   - **HTML:** tag balance (`<html>`, `<body>`, `<script>`), must end with `</html>`, JS brace balance
   - **Size:** new file must be ≥30% of old file size
3. If CI passes: backup → write → version bump → git commit+push to both repos
4. If CI fails: **nothing is written**, errors returned, chunks stay in staging

## Chat Persistence
- All chats saved to `~/.groq/chats/` as JSON files (local only, not in git)
- Auto-titled from first user message
- Double-click session name in sidebar to rename
- Server syncs on every save, loads from server on page load
- Endpoints: `GET /api/chats`, `GET /api/chats/<id>`, `POST /api/chats/save`, `POST /api/chats/rename`, `POST /api/chats/delete`

## Rules
1. Edit in the repo, run `./install.sh`, restart `qwen`; never edit only ~/.groq.
2. Before each commit: `grep -rn 'gsk_' .` must find nothing. State files are in `.gitignore`.
3. No Mac build (it is Python). Push to main.
4. Write every correction and new feature back into TAKEOVER.md and LESSONS.md at the close.
5. **Never commit truncated code.** The CI pipeline rejects it automatically.

## Open work
All previously open items completed in v3:
- Local API Origin/CSRF guard + `X-Queen-Token` (`~/.groq/api_token`) added.
- Key pools unified in `groq_pool.py` (`DynamicKeyPool` + `KeyPool`).
- Streaming usage now reads `chunk.x_groq.usage` + `reasoning_tokens` and `MODEL_PRICING` / `LIVE_MODEL_PRICING` expanded.
- Star Menu (`/api/star/*`), Voice Engine (`/api/voice/*`), and Elevate Media (`/api/elevate/*`) backend routes + web UI modals (`⭐`, `🔊`, `🎬`) built and verified.

## Run log
- 11.11.2026: repo created from the running v09; skill written. Backdoor chat tested (3 turns, works); token count per turn looks inflated, check it.
- 11.11.2026: v1 upgrade — CI pipeline, self-update panel, auto-update GitHub repo, version tracking, server-side chat persistence, chat rename.
- 11.11.2026: Added `GEMINI.md` workspace rule — mandatory handover + skill update after every code change. Both repos now public.
- 11.11.2026: Testing session — fixed 3 bugs: CI false positives (bracket counting demoted to warnings), GIT_ROOT now detects installed vs source repo, assemble writes to both copies. All tests pass. Version bumped to v2. Testing skill written at `skills/groq-ai-studio-testing/SKILL.md`.
- 11.11.2026: Added `.agents/skills.json` manifest, visible macOS Terminal test runner (`skills/groq-ai-studio-testing/scripts/run_visible_tests.sh`), Python server live-test backdoors (`POST /api/test/live`, `POST /api/terminal/log`, `'t'` terminal key), and `build_queen_system_prompt()` so Queen always knows how she self-updates. Verified 9/9 live checks + backdoor chat in Terminal.app.
- 11.11.2026: v3 upgrade — finished all unfinished features: `/api/star/*` + `⭐` Star Menu UI, `/api/voice/*` + `🔊` Voice Engine UI & per-message Speak button, `/api/elevate/*` + `🎬` Elevate Media Production Hub UI, unified `groq_pool.py`, `local_api_security_guard` (`Origin`/`Referer`/`X-Queen-Token`), `x_groq.usage` exact token tracking, and working Stop button. Verified 13/13 live checks + backdoor chat visibly in macOS Terminal.app.
- 11.11.2026: v4 (Step 1) — Created minute-detail `skills/queen-auto-update-pipeline/SKILL.md` covering Dual-Kind API Loader (`Groq` vs. `Google`/`Anthropic`), pre-briefed surgical patching, USD cost ledger, and "Learning by Watching" split-screen UI; updated `.gitignore`, `install.sh` (copies `qwen_app/auto_updater.py`), and `.agents/skills.json`.
- 11.11.2026: v4 complete — Built `qwen_app/auto_updater.py`, wired `/api/auto_update/*` & Dual-Kind `/api/keys*` into `qwen_app/app.py`, added Topbar Auto-Update Switch (`Google` | `Anthropic` + Model Picker) + Automatic 50/50 "Learning by Watching" Split-Screen Engineer Studio in `qwen_app/index.html`, fixed concurrent `.tmp` atomic-write race in `save_chat`, and verified 16/16 live checks + live Anthropic `claude-sonnet-4-5` surgical update (`8.52s`, `$0.026469 USD`) visibly in macOS Terminal.app.
- 12.11.2026: Affinity bridge (`qwen_app/affinity_bridge.py`, `/api/affinity/*`): Queen fires Affinity actions and JavaScript, renders back; paid Canva calls refused; refusals caught as `SystemExit` (400 with the reason). The client is loaded by path from MACRO_SKILLS; never name a file like a module it imports.

## Mistakes already made
- Looking for `qwen` with `which` in a tool shell: it is in ~/.groq, on the PATH only through ~/.zshrc.
- Treating a `gsk_` grep as a secret check: compare the real keys by exact match instead (script in the 11.11.2026 close).
- CI truncation heuristics (raw bracket/quote counting) block valid code: AST parse is the real gate; raw counts are informational only.
- Starting Queen headless without `< /dev/null`: the keyboard listener kills the process when stdin closes. Use `nohup ... < /dev/null > /tmp/qwen.log 2>&1 &`.
- `GIT_ROOT` resolved to `~/.groq` (installed copy) instead of source repo: git operations fail. Fixed with `.git` directory detection.

## Talking to it
`/api/remote/send` keeps the whole conversation in the server (`active_messages`, last 80 sent), so a test chat continues across
calls and also shows live in the open page. Send `system_prompt` each time. Each turn costs about $0.002 on qwen3.8-27b.

The Qwen model can read the auto-update repo (`markoboskoauroville/groq-auto-update`) through the GitHub Reader (🐙) in the UI. It knows this repo exists and can browse its files.

## Queen's own skills (queen_skills/, 12.11.2026)

affinity-open-close, band-poster, claude-link, describe-images, gemini-image, how-queen-works (her working rules and the
assessment), live-check, next-concert, read-screen (she looks at the Mac screen: /api/screen/look or chat "is there a subtitle on the screen?"), repo-reader, vision, web-photo; band profile santoshi_band.json. Each one has its route
in qwen_app/ and, where useful, a chat sentence answered locally. Restart Queen after any change (she caches modules) and
start her WITHOUT a Claude session's CLAUDE* variables.

## Run log
- 12.11.2026: skills folder; repo reader; eyes; local Claude link + consent gate; Affinity open/close; band posters, A4 poster-like,
  Gemini full-bleed + three stripes EN/HR (.af + .png in ~/Pictures/<date> <project>/); site image catalogue to Excel; Allow
  remote debugging by Macro Recorder; supervisor approve/reject; one chat per task; web-photo (Kukljica panorama live); live
  screenshot-and-compare self-check; tabbed UI with the lightning full-screen.
- 13.11.2026: VM Queen (two locations, same skills); screen reading; image-collect (grab mode zero cost, eyesheet/eyemark: Claude Code looks, never paid vision without Marko's OK; strict worship check; collage test in code; free stock hosts only); every paid call asks the Cost Agent gate (:9047, Speechify allowance $0.50/day to confirm); skills second-take-test (tools/rehearsal_test, read PASS/FAIL, still to be tested in her chat) and mpa-shooting corrections.
